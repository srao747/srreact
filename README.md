 Single Page Blog Website
This is a simple website that displays three blog posts on the main page with a 2-column layout. Each post includes a title, date, author, summary, and full text. The website also includes a navigation bar with a link to the homepage and a div that displays content from a third-party API, which is updated every 60 seconds.

Getting Started
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the main page of the website.
Click on any of the title links to view the full blog post on a separate page.
Use the navigation bar to go back to the homepage or view the third-party API content.
